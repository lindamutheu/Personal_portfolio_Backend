Hi, my name is Linda Musyoki, a junior Backend Developer with a strong foundation in Python, Django, RESTful API development,
transitioning from accounting into software development. 
This project is a personal portfolio  built with Django, REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and Celery.
It showcases my backend engineering skills through real-world data modeling, clean API design, asynchronous processing, 
and scalable architecture.
The API powers a frontend portfolio application and exposes structured endpointsfor professional profile data, projects, 
skills, experience, education, and contact messages.
